      <h2>Devon Curry</h2>
      Hello! I am currently studying software engineering and in my second semester here at BYUI<br> 
      I don't have much coding experience, But I am learning 3 coding languages this semester. And am very excited to expand my abilities.<br><br>
    
      I have 4 older siblings, 3 brothers and 1 sister. Music plays a big role in my life and I just switched from a music education major because I realized I want to make money.<br><br>
      I'm excited to be in this class and hope you all have an amazing semester!
