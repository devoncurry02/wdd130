        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People come to this site to see Rashelle’s hand-crafted pottery and artwork. They also come to see who she is as an artist, and how / where they can buy her work.
The questions this site will answer is where to find high-quality, hand-crafted pottery for anyone and everyone to enjoy. This site will also answer the following questions: What type of art does she create? Who is she as an artist? What background does she have? What other projects has she worked on / is working on? How can I contact her? How and where can I buy her pottery? Are there any events she is hosting or will be at? There will be links listed on the homepage to her gallery, upcoming events, and contact information that will answer all of these questions.
Visitor activities include viewing a photo gallery of her current and past work, watching video clips of her creating pottery and other artwork, and accessing the calendar to learn about upcoming events she’ll be at. Some of this will also be displayed on the homepage to draw people to look at the photo gallery. Each page will display her logo with a navigation and footer and at least one picture of her studio or art.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        The most important information needed is what Rashelle’s art looks like. This is a gallery and is intended for viewing. I plan on displaying a grid of images of her work on this page. After that’s taken care of, all that's required is a slight sales pitch. When selling art, it's important to describe it in a way that appeals to all senses. When providing descriptions for her art I intend to make it sound more like a story than a description, and to use this story to appeal to all of their senses. If you are looking to sell, you need to appeal.

      <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
      <p>
        Other information that is needed is upcoming events and her contact information. Visitors will come to this site because they are interested in her work, personally as an artist and her specific artwork. They will also come to learn how her art can liven up their homes and places of work. There will be a short biography about Rashelle along with her credentials for people to connect with her so they will be more likely to support her.
